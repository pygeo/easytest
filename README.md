Easytest
========

Easytest is a simple framework for testing results from arbitrary kind of programs. You can e.g. check if your program is producing the expected output as desired. It might be a helpfull tool for automated testing and be part on a continuous development cycle. Currenlty it was in particular used for testing of python programs in combination with [nosetests](http://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>).

The documentation including installation instructions can be found [here](http://easytest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
